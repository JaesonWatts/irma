# READM

This is the backend for Illender's Roleplay Management Application-inator, aka 'IRMA'.
This api was written with this frontend located at:
https://github.com/JaesonWatts/irma-frontend

This was written in Ruby 2.6.1 with Rails 6.0.3 while the front end is a single page application written in JavaScript.
PostgreSQL was used in development as the database and is the intended production database but a skilled engineer should be able to modify this as needed.
